/* Output: 

We first deployed the fundMe contract using yarn hardhat deploy --tags fundme --network goerli 
I used training acc (2nd acc to deploy the contract) - did take some time

Output of dployment: 
Nothing to compile
The name of the network is goerli and chainID is 5
The price feed address is 0xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e

Successfully submitted source code for contract

for verification on the block explorer. Waiting for verification result...

Successfully verified contract FundMe on Etherscan.
https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xCb1574b49e711A2acE39766517Df86b0740BF238#code
The contract is verified ............
The contract need not be verified - You're on local chain (**This one I fixed the else statement in verification function)


** After eploying we can run yarn hardhat test --network goerli, but due to less eth available in goerli - I tested in bnb chain

    âœ” Test to see if we can fund the contract and then withdraw from it (13153ms)

  even we parse eth - 0.2 bnb token got funded and then transferred back
